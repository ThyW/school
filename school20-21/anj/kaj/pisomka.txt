My personal experience with arts is not vast by any means.
While I enjoy listening to some music and watching action movie,
I have never been to any large gallery with world renowned authors, nor have I ever seen a famous canvas or sculpture in person.
In fact, when I think about it now, I have never even considered picking up a brush or an easel. 
My family has never seriously encouraged me to start playing a musical instrument, or go visit an art class. 
Even later on in life, I have never thought about doing art myself, as I am mostly interested in technical subjects such as math and computing technologies.
From time to time, mostly when I have too much time, I start thinking about learning a music instrument, but that never gets me anywhere as I find more arguments against learning it than I find arguments in favor.
As for my attitude, I would go as far as to claim, that I understand art, but in a very particular way.
My own definition of art is a form of mastery of some subject.
That means, that everything, that introduces me to a particular degree of mastery, I consider art.

First picture depicts a room full of people, who are looking at paintings, which are hanged on the walls of the room.
The second picture also depicts a room full of people, however, this room is way larger than the one on the first picture, and instead of standing around looking at paintings, people are sitting on theirs seats, focused on an orchestra on a podium.
Picture one also shows some of the people having headphones on, whereas the picture two shows no such thing. 
Judging by the paintings on the wall, I am pretty confident in saying, that the first picture shows some kind of an art gallery or a museum.
The second picture takes place in, what I reckon is a theater building, and is mostly likely an opera. 
Personally I prefer art galleries to operas or theaters, because I find trying to interpret paintings myself more pleasing than listening to a concert.

One of the problems with advice is, that people tend to interpret it to suit their own purposes. 
An example of this is the wisdom of the 18th century economist, Adam Smith. 
One of his main ideas was that if you allow people to seek wealth for themselves, they will naturally create jobs for themselves.
He called this the invisible hand.
People, trying to improve their own situation, also help their neighbour to improve theirs but without meaning to, as if with an invisible hand. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people took Smith to mean as greedy and selfish and that he won't help others indirectly, which is not what he meant.

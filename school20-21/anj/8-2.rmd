I would love to have en suite bathroom, sate-of-the-art kitchen and probably a swimming pool. Having a bathroom adjacent to your bedroom is just extremely convenient, as well as having a fully stocked, modern kitchen. Having a swimming pool is an absolutely amazing investment, since you can use your own swimming pool instead of wasting money for going to public swimming pools.

# My hood
I live in a small *residential* area, on a calm, *tree-lined* street in the heart of Petrzalka. 
Our cozy, *three-bedroom*, *third-floor* apartment is located in an *eight-storey* *residential* building. We also live right next to a small forest, if you can even call it that, which is perfect for going on a walks with friends or family.
